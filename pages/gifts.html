    <h1>Gifts</h1>
    <p class="voice-note">Julie writes:</p>

    <p>I confess that I do love receiving presents, and Anthony* loves seeing me happy, so he and Elizabeth, my maid of honour, have encouraged me not to limit guests solely to charitable donations. Obviously we have everything we need, so what does my heart want? First and foremost, I love handmade items and anything created by my loved ones would have particular significance. A crocheted blanket, a pretty brooch, a hand-thrown pot, a watercolour sketch or a song &mdash; whatever your medium, all would be treasured.</p>

    <p>If you are less creatively inclined, here are some makers I love (in no particular order):</p>

    <h2>Makers</h2>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Absolutely Frivolous</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/absolutelyfrivolous1">Etsy shop</a></p>
        <p>I have expensive taste! Not so keen on the earrings but I adore the necklaces, brooches, and even the peacock hat that are available here at time of writing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Old Stony Hill Ceramics</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.oldstonyhill.co.uk/">oldstonyhill.co.uk</a></p>
        <p>I find Katherine's art incredibly moving and have been collecting her "Little Ladies" for a while now, but always happy to add more (or indeed larger figural pieces).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Fungi Spirits</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.numonday.com/shop/fungi-spirits-store/">Numonday shop</a></p>
        <p>I commissioned a sitting Amanita Muscaria from this maker sometime back and it's one of the most beautiful handmade things I have ever seen. She could do with a friend, but I prefer mushrooms (sitting or wall-mounted) to fairies, gnomes etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Metier Mosaics (Jane Cowen Davies)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetierMosaics/">Facebook page</a></p>
        <p>Jane is one of my favourite local artists and makes the most stunning mosaics from vintage china. I would love to have anything from her, but particularly covet one of her birds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Precious Heart Beads</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PreciousHeartBeads">Etsy shop</a></p>
        <p>The most stunning bead embroidery jewellery and kits. I would love anything from here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Alisa Sonya</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AlisaSonya">Etsy shop</a></p>
        <p>I adore the finished scarves and shawls, particularly the soft pastel coloured ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listing">
        <h3>Stiwdio Genau'r Glyn</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/stiwdiogenaurglyn">Facebook page</a></p>
        <p>Would absolutely adore one of their figures &mdash; I have admired the ones representing the seasons in the past.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Generally "Safe" Categories</h2>

    <p>If you'd prefer to choose something yourself, these categories (handmade and/or secondhand) are generally safe bets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jewellery</strong> &mdash; beautifully handmade, or embellished with lots of detail, or encrusted with sparkling rhinestones. No need for anything more precious than silver, or any precious stones.</li>
        <li><strong>Textiles</strong> &mdash; knit, crochet (especially freeform), lace, absolutely anything embroidered, tribal/ethnic from just about any culture, and the Holy Grail: a vintage Welsh tapestry blanket.</li>
        <li><strong>Handmade wooden items</strong> &mdash; turned bowls, lovespoons, old boxes, sturdy baskets.</li>
        <li><strong>Ceramics</strong> &mdash; kitsch is good, from misshapen mid-Century cats to Dresden-style floral encrusted rococo pieces, but also simple, functional handmade mugs and bowls. One maker I love is Derek Fowler.</li>
        <li><strong>Old religious art</strong> &mdash; I dream of painted statues of saints.</li>
        <li><strong>Quirky assemblage pieces</strong></li>
        <li>&hellip;and just about anything with a <strong>mushroom</strong> motif!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course, if you prefer to make a charitable donation instead, we suggest <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">*Anthony is impossible to buy for, even after knowing him for 30 years. Luckily he is also fairly indifferent to gifts and his present to me is to encourage me to let people buy / make with me in mind.</p>
