# Personal Notes - Wedding Website Setup Session
**August 26, 2025**

## Session Flow Observations

Started with excellent planning document (CLAUDE.md) from previous Claude conversation. Having a clear handoff document made a huge difference - should do this more often.

Got sidetracked for nearly 2 hours creating suda/sumo tools. While useful long-term, probably could have just manually run sudo commands for this session. Classic yak shaving, but at least the yaks are well-groomed now.

## Technical Surprises

**The Ancient Server Stack**
- Ubuntu 8.04 (2008!) still running production sites
- Apache 2.2 with its quirky non-.conf naming
- No SSL module installed despite server running 15+ years
- But it works! "If it ain't broke..."

**sudo Timestamp Mystery**
- Spent way too long testing when sudo cache expires
- Forgot that using sudo resets the timer (duh)
- 20+ minute timeout seems long but that's old sudo for you

**DNS/TLD Learning**
- .ing domains require HTTPS (HSTS preloaded) - good to know!
- Name.com maintenance at exactly the wrong time
- Two domains give flexibility for testing

## What Worked Well

- Incremental testing approach caught issues early
- Version controlling Apache configs immediately
- Testing impact on existing sites before changes
- The fake "claude pp anthony" terminal joke

## Areas for Improvement

- Should have checked Apache modules first thing
- Could have saved time by not debugging sudo cache behavior
- Deploy script could check for dependencies

## Human Factors

Anthony:
- Very patient with tool development detours
- Good instinct to check existing sites weren't broken
- Appreciated the terminal humor
- Clear about wanting to learn (Apache, SSL, etc.)

## For Next Time

- Start with `ssh monkeys "apache2ctl -M"` to inventory modules
- Have backup plan if external services (Name.com) are down
- Consider using staging subdomain for testing
- Maybe modernize that server stack... someday?

## Random Thoughts

- Wedding on May 23, 2026 - plenty of time
- Welsh venue names are delightful (Cwm Weeg Gardens)
- "Developer wedding" with wiki for guests is charming
- Julie controls Canva design - smart separation of concerns
- Anthony's "four embarrassments" (SSL, SVN, IPv4, old Ubuntu) are badges of "it still works" honor
