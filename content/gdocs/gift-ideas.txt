I confess that I do love receiving presents, and Anthony* loves seeing me happy, so he and Elizabeth, my maid of honour, have encouraged me not to limit guests solely to charitable donations. Obviously we have everything we need, so what does my heart want? First and foremost, I love handmade items and anything created by my loved ones would have particular significance. A crocheted blanket, a pretty brooch, a hand-thrown pot, a watercolour sketch or a song - whatever your medium, all would be treasured. If you are less creatively inclined, here are some makers I love (in no particular order):


Absolutely Frivolous
https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/absolutelyfrivolous1
I have expensive taste! Not so keen on the earrings but I adore the necklaces, brooches, and even the peacock hat that are available here at time of writing.


Old Stony Hill Ceramics
https://www.oldstonyhill.co.uk/
I find Katherine's art incredibly moving and have been collecting her "Little Ladies" for awhile now, but always happy to add more (or indeed larger figural pieces).


Fungi Spirits
https://www.numonday.com/shop/fungi-spirits-store/
I commissioned a sitting Amanita Muscaria from this maker sometime back and it's one of the most beautiful handmade things I have ever seen. She could do with a friend, but I prefer mushrooms (sitting or wall-mounted) to fairies, gnomes etc.


Metier Mosaics (Jane Cowen Davies)
https://www.facebook.com/MetierMosaics/
Jane is one of my favourite local artists and makes the most stunning mosaics from vintage china. I would love to have anything from her, but particularly covet one of her birds.


Precious Heart Beads
https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PreciousHeartBeads
The most stunning bead embroidery jewellery and kits. I would love anything from here.


Alisa Sonya
https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AlisaSonya
I adore the finished scarves and shawls, particularly the soft pastel coloured ones


Moth Embroidery shop
https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/mothembroideryshop
The most beautiful gloves I have ever seen


Stiwdio Genau'r Glyn
https://www.facebook.com/stiwdiogenaurglyn
Would absolutely adore one of their figures - I have admired the ones representing the seasons in the past.


Generally "Safe" categories for gifts (handmade and/or secondhand) include:
Jewellery (beautifully handmade, or embellished with lots of detail, or encrusted with sparkling rhinestones - no need for anything more precious than silver, or any precious stones)
Textiles (knit, crochet - especially freeform, lace, absolutely anything embroidered, tribal / ethnic from just about any culture, and the Holy Grail: a vintage Welsh tapestry blanket)
Handmade wooden items - turned bowls, lovespoons, old boxes, sturdy baskets
Ceramics (kitsch is good, from misshapen mid-Century cats to Dresden-style floral encrusted rococo pieces, but also simple, functional handmade mugs and bowls. One maker I love is Derek Fowler)
Old religious art (I dream of painted statues of saints)
Quirky assemblage pieces
…and just about anything with a mushroom motif!




*You may notice this list is very off-balance. Anthony is impossible to buy for, even after knowing him for 30 years. Luckily he is also fairly indifferent to gifts and his present to me is to encourage me to let people buy / make with me in mind.
