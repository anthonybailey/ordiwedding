Travel:
If staying in Berriew, your nearest train station will be Welshpool. If nearer Cwm Weeg, stay on a bit longer for Newtown.

Nearest major airport is Birmingham which has direct train links to Newtown and Welshpool. From there, you will likely need to arrange a taxi service. Definitely urge you to do this in advance as they tend to be thin on the ground in this area and not always reliable. May be worth seeking advice from your accommodation or contact us and we can try to help.

Transport for Wales is, alas, notoriously unreliable. Expect delays, rail replacement coaches, etc. Anthony has found it usually works well to depart train in Shrewsbury and get a coach to Newtown/Welshpool, some of which stop directly in Berriew (please check for details!)

Please contact us for advice if you are struggling to organise travel.

Accommodation:
Guest accommodation in this area is mostly in the form of airBnB accommodation, campsites, and pubs with a handful of rooms.

Although Newtown is near to Cwm Weeg, it does not rely on tourist trade and therefore is not particularly well-served with reliable restaurants, accommodation, etc.

We recommend guests book rooms either in Berriew or at the Penllwyn Lodges site (see below) as we are arranging a coach to transport guests between the museum in Berriew and Cwm Weeg. If you do not want to drive on the day, we highly recommend sticking to one of these properties as local taxi services can be unreliable.

We've also included a number of self-catering properties in the area, and the pretty and historic town of Montgomery is also nearby and home to several highly recommended B&Bs.

Again, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about accommodation or special requirements we might be able to advise on.

Traditional pub with recently refurbished rooms, conveniently situated next door to museum.

Nag's Head

Penllwyn Lodges
